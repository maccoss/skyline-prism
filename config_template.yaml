# =============================================================================
# Data Column Mapping
# =============================================================================
# Map your Skyline report column names to PRISM internal names.
# These are the defaults for standard Skyline exports.

data:
  # Abundance measurement column (usually from transitions)
  abundance_column: "TotalAreaFragment"  # or "TotalAreaMs1" for MS1 quant
  
  # Retention time column
  rt_column: "BestRetentionTime"
  
  # Peptide identification
  peptide_column: "PeptideModifiedSequence"  # Modified forms are separate peptides
  
  # For transition-level data (optional)
  precursor_column: "PrecursorCharge"
  fragment_column: "FragmentIon"
  
  # Protein identification
  protein_column: "ProteinAccession"  # UniProt accessions preferred
  protein_name_column: "ProteinName"
  
  # Sample identification
  sample_column: "ReplicateName"
  batch_column: "Batch"
  run_order_column: "RunOrder"
  sample_type_column: "SampleType"

# =============================================================================
# Sample Type Detection
# =============================================================================
# Patterns to automatically identify sample types from replicate names.
# Uses regex matching (case-insensitive).

sample_annotations:
  # Inter-experiment reference (commercial pool for calibration)
  reference_pattern: "GoldenWest|CommercialPool|InterExpRef|Reference"
  
  # Intra-experiment pool (pooled experimental samples for validation)
  pool_pattern: "StudyPool|IntraPool|ExpPool|QCPool"
  
  # Experimental samples (everything else by default)
  experimental_pattern: "^(?!.*(Pool|Ref)).*"

# =============================================================================
# Batch Estimation
# =============================================================================
# When batch information is not provided in metadata, PRISM estimates batches
# using: 1) source_document, 2) acquisition time gaps, or 3) equal division.
#
# Include "Result File > Acquired Time" in your Skyline report for best results.

batch_estimation:
  # Expected samples per batch (for validation and fallback estimation)
  min_samples_per_batch: 12   # Typical 96-well plate minimum
  max_samples_per_batch: 100  # Typical 96-well plate maximum
  
  # IQR multiplier for outlier gap detection
  # A gap is considered a batch break if: gap > Q3 + (multiplier * IQR)
  # 
  # Example: If runs are typically 65 min apart (±2 min), the IQR would be ~4 min.
  # With multiplier=1.5, threshold ≈ 67 + 1.5*4 = 73 min.
  # An overnight break (e.g., 90 min gap) would be detected as a batch boundary.
  gap_iqr_multiplier: 1.5
  
  # Force a specific number of batches (null = automatic estimation)
  # Only used if other estimation methods fail
  n_batches: null

# =============================================================================
# Stage 0: Transition to Peptide Rollup
# =============================================================================
# Only used if input is transition-level data from Skyline.

transition_rollup:
  enabled: false  # Set true if input has individual transitions
  
  # Rollup method: median_polish, sum, quality_weighted
  method: "median_polish"
  
  # Whether to include MS1 signal in quantification
  use_ms1: false  # Fragment-based is typically more specific
  
  # Minimum transitions required per peptide
  min_transitions: 3
  
  # Learn variance model from reference samples (only for quality_weighted)
  # When true, optimizes variance model parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, delta)
  # by minimizing median CV across peptides in reference samples.
  # Requires at least 2 reference samples.
  learn_variance_model: false
  
  # For quality_weighted method - explicit variance model parameters
  # Only used if learn_variance_model is false. If neither is specified,
  # sensible defaults are used.
  # 
  # variance_model:
  #   alpha: 1.0        # Shot noise coefficient (Poisson)
  #   beta: 0.01        # Multiplicative noise coefficient
  #   gamma: 100.0      # Additive noise floor
  #   delta: 2.0        # Quality penalty coefficient
  #   shape_corr_exponent: 2.0  # Exponent for shape correlation penalty
  #   coelution_penalty: 0.5    # Penalty for non-coeluting transitions
  
  # Skyline quality columns to use (if available)
  quality_columns:
    shape_correlation: "ShapeCorrelation"
    coeluting: "Coeluting"

# =============================================================================
# Stage 1: RT-Aware Normalization (DISABLED BY DEFAULT)
# =============================================================================
# Reference-anchored correction for RT-dependent technical variation.
#
# NOTE: RT correction is DISABLED by default. DIA-NN and other search engines
# apply per-file RT calibration that may not generalize between reference and
# experimental samples, making spline-based RT correction unreliable.
#
# The implementation is preserved for future experimentation.

rt_correction:
  enabled: false  # Disabled by default - see note above
  
  # Method: spline, loess, ruv, combat_rt
  method: "spline"
  
  # Degrees of freedom for spline (higher = more flexible)
  spline_df: 5
  
  # Fit separate models per batch (recommended if enabled)
  per_batch: true
  
  # Minimum peptides per RT bin for robust estimation
  min_peptides_per_bin: 10

# =============================================================================
# Stage 2: Global Normalization
# =============================================================================
# Address overall sample loading differences.

global_normalization:
  # Method: median, vsn, quantile, none
  #
  # median   - Subtract sample median; shifts all samples to common baseline
  #            Simple, robust, and preserves original log2 scale
  #            RECOMMENDED for most proteomics experiments
  #
  # vsn      - Variance Stabilizing Normalization using arcsinh transformation
  #            Stabilizes variance across intensity range (heteroscedasticity)
  #            Output is on arcsinh-transformed scale, NOT log2
  #            Use when low-abundance proteins show high variance
  #
  # quantile - Forces identical sample distributions
  #            Strong normalization that may over-correct
  #
  # none     - Skip global normalization
  #
  method: "median"

  # VSN parameters (only used when method: vsn)
  vsn_params:
    # Whether to optimize transformation parameters per sample
    # - false (default): Use fast median-based scaling (a = 1/median)
    # - true: Optimize parameters to minimize variance heterogeneity
    #         using Nelder-Mead optimization. Slower but may give
    #         better variance stabilization for some datasets.
    optimize_params: false

# =============================================================================
# Stage 3: Batch Correction
# =============================================================================
# Remove systematic batch effects using ComBat (empirical Bayes).

batch_correction:
  enabled: true
  
  # Method: combat, none
  # ComBat uses empirical Bayes shrinkage for robust batch effect estimation
  method: "combat"

# =============================================================================
# Protein Parsimony
# =============================================================================
# How to handle shared peptides that map to multiple proteins.
#
# IMPORTANT: Parsimony requires the search FASTA database to correctly
# determine peptide-to-protein mappings. Peptides are matched to proteins
# using direct sequence lookup.

parsimony:
  # Path to the FASTA database used for the original search
  # REQUIRED for correct peptide-to-protein mapping
  fasta_path: null  # e.g., "/path/to/uniprot_human_reviewed.fasta"
  
  # Strategy: all_groups, unique_only, razor
  # 
  # all_groups (recommended): Apply shared peptides to ALL protein groups
  #   - Acknowledges proteoform complexity
  #   - Avoids assumptions based on FASTA annotations
  #
  # unique_only: Only use peptides unique to a single protein group
  #   - Most conservative
  #   - May lose proteins with few unique peptides
  #
  # razor: Assign shared peptides to group with most peptides
  #   - MaxQuant-style
  #   - Makes strong assumptions about protein presence
  
  shared_peptide_handling: "all_groups"

# =============================================================================
# Protein Rollup
# =============================================================================
# Combine peptides into protein-level quantities.

protein_rollup:
  # Method for combining peptides into protein abundances:
  #
  # median_polish (recommended): Tukey median polish - robust two-way decomposition
  #   - Separates peptide ionization effects from sample abundances
  #   - Automatically downweights outliers through median operation
  #   - Handles missing values naturally
  #
  # topn: Average of top N most intense peptides (SAME peptides across all samples)
  #   - Selects N peptides with highest median abundance across samples
  #   - Uses those SAME peptides for all samples (ensures comparability)
  #   - Simple and interpretable
  #   - Selected peptides are reported in output
  #
  # ibaq: iBAQ (Intensity-Based Absolute Quantification)
  #   - Sum of intensities / theoretical peptide count
  #   - Enables cross-protein abundance comparison
  #   - Requires FASTA and enzyme settings (see ibaq section below)
  #
  # maxlfq: Maximum LFQ algorithm (MaxQuant-style)
  #   - Uses median pairwise peptide ratios between samples
  #   - Good when relative quantification is more reliable than absolute
  #
  # sum: Simple sum of all peptide intensities
  #   - Fast but sensitive to outliers
  #
  method: "median_polish"
  
  # Top-N specific settings (used when method: topn)
  topn:
    n: 3                              # Number of top peptides to use
    selection: "median_abundance"     # How to rank: median_abundance, frequency
  
  # iBAQ specific settings (REQUIRED when method: ibaq)
  # iBAQ normalizes protein abundances by the number of theoretical peptides
  ibaq:
    fasta_path: null                  # Path to search FASTA (REQUIRED for iBAQ)
    enzyme: "trypsin"                 # Enzyme for theoretical digestion
    missed_cleavages: 0               # Typically 0 for iBAQ counting
    min_peptide_length: 6             # Minimum peptide length
    max_peptide_length: 30            # Maximum peptide length
  
  # For topn method
  topn:
    n: 3  # Number of peptides to select
    # Selection criterion: how to rank peptides for selection
    # Options:
    #   - median_abundance: Peptides with highest median across samples (default)
    #   - frequency: Peptides detected in most samples, then by abundance
    selection: "median_abundance"
  
  # For median_polish method
  median_polish:
    max_iterations: 10
    convergence_tolerance: 0.0001
