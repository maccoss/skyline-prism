# Sample Type Detection
# =============================================================================
# Patterns to automatically identify sample types from replicate names.
# Uses regex matching (case-insensitive).

sample_annotations:

  reference_pattern: "GoldenWest|CommercialPool|InterExpRef|Reference"
  
  # Intra-experiment pool (pooled experimental samples for validation)

  # Experimental samples (everything else by default)

# =============================================================================
# Stage 0: Transition to Peptide Rollup
# =============================================================================
# Only used if input is transition-level data from Skyline.

transition_rollup:
  enabled: false  # Set true if input has individual transitions
  
  # Rollup method: median_polish, sum, quality_weighted

  # For quality_weighted method - variance model parameters
  # These are learned from reference samples if not specified
  variance_model:
    alpha: 1.0        # Shot noise coefficient (Poisson)
    beta: 0.01        # Multiplicative noise coefficient

# Stage 1: RT-Aware Normalization (DISABLED BY DEFAULT)
# =============================================================================
# Reference-anchored correction for RT-dependent technical variation.
#
# NOTE: RT correction is DISABLED by default. DIA-NN and other search engines
# apply per-file RT calibration that may not generalize between reference and
# experimental samples, making spline-based RT correction unreliable.
#
# The implementation is preserved for future experimentation.

rt_correction:
  enabled: false  # Disabled by default - see note above
  
  # Method: spline, loess, ruv, combat_rt
  method: "spline"
  
  # Degrees of freedom for spline (higher = more flexible)

  # Fit separate models per batch (recommended if enabled)

# =============================================================================
# Protein Parsimony
# =============================================================================
# How to handle shared peptides that map to multiple proteins.

parsimony:
  # Strategy: all_groups, unique_only, razor
  # 
  # all_groups (recommended): Apply shared peptides to ALL protein groups
  #   - Acknowledges proteoform complexity
  #   - Avoids assumptions based on FASTA annotations
  #
  # unique_only: Only use peptides unique to a single protein group
  #   - Most conservative
  #   - May lose proteins with few unique peptides
  #
  # razor: Assign shared peptides to group with most peptides
  #   - MaxQuant-style
  #   - Makes strong assumptions about protein presence
  
  shared_peptide_handling: "all_groups"

# =============================================================================
# Protein Rollup
# =============================================================================
# Combine peptides into protein-level quantities.

protein_rollup:
  # Method for combining peptides into protein abundances:
  #
  # median_polish (recommended): Tukey median polish - robust two-way decomposition
  #   - Separates peptide ionization effects from sample abundances
  #   - Automatically downweights outliers through median operation
  #   - Handles missing values naturally
  #
  # topn: Average of top N most intense peptides per sample
  #   - Simple and fast
  #   - Assumes most intense peptides are most reliable
  #
  # ibaq: Intensity-Based Absolute Quantification
  #   - Total intensity / number of theoretical peptides
  #   - Enables cross-protein abundance comparisons
  #   - Requires theoretical peptide count per protein
  #
  # maxlfq: Maximum LFQ algorithm (MaxQuant-style)
  #   - Uses median pairwise peptide ratios between samples
  #   - Good when relative quantification is more reliable than absolute
  #
  # quality_weighted: Variance-model weighted average
  #   - Weights peptides by inverse predicted variance
  #   - Requires quality metrics (ShapeCorrelation, Coeluting)
  #
  # sum: Simple sum of all peptide intensities
  #   - Similar to spectral counting
  #   - Not recommended for label-free quantification
  #
  method: "median_polish"
  
  # Minimum peptides required per protein (fewer = flagged)
  min_peptides: 3
  
  # For topn method: number of peptides to average
  topn_n: 3
  
  # For ibaq method: theoretical peptide count (per protein)
  # Usually provided via protein database annotation
  ibaq_theoretical_peptides: null
  
  # For median_polish method
  median_polish:
    max_iterations: 10
    convergence_tolerance: 0.0001
