# Skyline-PRISM (C#) dotnet-vNEXT Release Notes

Working draft for the next C# (.NET) release. Append entries as they land on the development branch;
rename to `RELEASE_NOTES_dotnet-v{version}.md` at release time - the release workflow publishes this file
as the GitHub Release description and fails if it is missing.

## New Features

- **The QC report shows peak quality in acquisition order, so a degraded or different run stands
  out across a cohort.** The new "Peak Quality by Acquisition Order" section scores Skyline's own
  shape correlation, isotope dot product, retention time and FWHM for every precursor in every run, as
  a robust z against that precursor's median across runs, and plots each run's median score and
  10-90% range in the order the runs were acquired. Runs whose median exceeds twice the cohort's are
  labeled and listed beside the cohort's typical values, and a second plot stacks each metric's
  per-run median so the one that moved can be read straight down. On a 96-run cohort it singled out
  exactly the two Internal Control injections - median shape correlation 0.66 against 0.82, eluting
  0.12 min early - the same two runs MSstats+'s anomaly scores found, with a deterministic score
  pinned to a numpy/scipy golden instead of an isolation forest. It is computed from `merged_data/`
  each time the report is made (about 20 s for 30 million transition rows) and can be turned off
  with `qc_report.peak_quality: false`.
- **`sample_metadata.csv` now carries `acquired_time` and `run_order`** for every cohort whose report
  has Skyline's Acquired Time, after the four resolved columns, which keep their positions. Run order
  is each replicate's place in the acquisition sequence - the same number the peak-quality plot gives
  it - so the injection order no longer has to be typed into Skyline as an annotation to be available
  downstream.

## Bug Fixes

- **`prism run --from-provenance <parameters.json> -c <overrides.yaml>` stopped ignoring the
  overrides.** The `-c` had been dropped without a word whenever a provenance file was given, so the
  documented way to change one setting of an earlier run re-ran its old settings unchanged. Each key
  the YAML set replaced the earlier run's value and every other key was kept; a subsection merged key
  by key and a list was replaced whole. The run log named the overridden keys, an unrecognized key
  warned as it did with a plain `-c`, and a file that changed no setting said so.
- **A config section with every key under it commented out stopped failing the run.** A bare
  `transition_rollup:` had stopped it with "Object reference not set to an instance of an object",
  and any other bare section had left a null for a later stage to trip over. An empty section kept
  its defaults.
- **The run log started recording what was said while the config was read.** An unrecognized
  config key's `WARNING` and the `NOTE` that a moved FASTA had been replaced by its archived copy
  were printed before `prism_run_*.log` was opened, so they had gone to stderr only; a scripted run
  that discarded stderr left a log that read as though every setting had been honored. They were
  written at the top of the log as well, in the order they were said. The log section of
  `docs/output_files.md`, which still showed the retired Python engine's time-stamped format, was
  rewritten from a real run.
- Corrected documentation that contradicted the code, with no change to any output. `docs/output_files.md`
  and `SPECIFICATION.md` listed a `Coeluting` column the bundled `Skyline-PRISM` report has never exported,
  and `docs/output_files.md` omitted the `Background` column it does export (nothing reads it).
