# Skyline-PRISM (C#) dotnet-vNEXT Release Notes

Working draft for the next C# (.NET) release. Append entries as they land on the development branch;
rename to `RELEASE_NOTES_dotnet-v{version}.md` at release time - the release workflow publishes this file
as the GitHub Release description and fails if it is missing.

## New Features

## Bug Fixes

- **Re-running an analysis onto a network share could fail Stage 1, and a stopped run could destroy
  the previous merge.** Both came from the same thing: the merge deleted `merged_data/` and then had
  DuckDB rewrite the same path. `Directory.Delete` only *starts* a removal - on Windows a directory
  survives until its last handle closes, and over SMB neither the server-side removal nor the
  client's directory cache is synchronous with the return - so the rebuild raced the teardown and
  failed with `Cannot open file "...\merged_data\_pep_bucket=1\data_0.parquet": The system cannot
  find the path specified`, after `_pep_bucket=0` had already been written. The merge is now built in
  a staging directory beside the target and renamed into place only once it has succeeded.

  The second half is the one to know about even off a share: any failure after the delete - pressing
  **Stop** during Stage 1, a full disk, the share going away - used to leave the output directory
  with no merged data, or worse, with *some* of the partitions. A partial one reads as a whole one,
  so the Spectrum density pane would plot a fraction of the cohort with nothing to say it was
  incomplete. A failed or cancelled merge now leaves the previous one untouched.
