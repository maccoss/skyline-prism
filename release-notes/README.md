# Release Notes

This directory contains per-version release notes for Skyline-PRISM.

## Versioning Scheme

Skyline-PRISM uses a `YY.feature.patch` versioning convention:

- **YY**: Two-digit year (e.g., `26` for 2026)
- **feature**: Incremented for each release containing new features
- **patch**: Incremented for bug-fix-only releases within the same feature version

Examples: `26.1.0` (first feature release of 2026), `26.1.1` (patch), `26.2.0` (second feature release).

The package version in `pyproject.toml` is updated only at release time, not during development.

## File Format

Each release gets one file: `RELEASE_NOTES_v{version}.md`. During development, the unreleased draft lives in `RELEASE_NOTES_next.md` and gets renamed at release time.

```text
release-notes/
  README.md                      # this file
  RELEASE_NOTES_next.md          # working draft for the next release
  RELEASE_NOTES_v26.3.3.md
  RELEASE_NOTES_v26.4.0.md
```

## Writing Release Notes

### During Development

Maintain `RELEASE_NOTES_next.md` as a working draft for the next planned version. Append entries as features and fixes land on the development branch. The file is unversioned until the release is finalized so the target version can change (e.g., a planned patch release becomes a feature release once new functionality is added).

### Content Structure

Each release notes file should use this structure:

```markdown
# Skyline-PRISM v{version} Release Notes

One-sentence summary of the release.

## New Features

- Feature descriptions grouped by area (e.g., Rollup, Batch Correction, QC)
- Focus on what changed from the user's perspective, not implementation details

## Bug Fixes

- Description of the bug and its impact
- What was fixed

## Performance

- Performance improvements with context (e.g., "Reduced memory from 35 GB to 8 GB for 100-parquet experiments")

## Breaking Changes

- Any changes that require user action (config format changes, removed options, etc.)
- Omit this section if there are no breaking changes
```

Sections can be omitted if empty. For major releases with many changes, subsections within each category are fine. For patch releases, a flat list is sufficient.

### Style

- Write in past tense ("Added", "Fixed", "Removed")
- Lead with user impact, not implementation details
- Include specific numbers where relevant (e.g., memory reduction, sample counts, file sizes)
- Reference config options by their CLI flag or YAML key name
- Reference modified files with paths so reviewers can locate the change

## Release Process

1. Finalize `RELEASE_NOTES_next.md` on the development branch
2. Rename it: `git mv release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_next.md release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v{version}.md`
3. Update the title heading inside the file to match the version
4. Create a fresh empty `RELEASE_NOTES_next.md` for the following release
5. Update `version` in `pyproject.toml` to match the release
6. Commit the version bump and renames
7. Merge to `main`
8. Tag: `git tag v{version}`
9. Push: `git push origin main --tags`
